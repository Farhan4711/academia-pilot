## Problem it solves
Creating content for multiple platforms is exhausting. This prompt transforms a single source of truth into a multi-platform distribution engine, ensuring consistent messaging while adapting the tone for each platform.

## The Prompt
```text
I have this content: [PASTE CONTENT]

Repurpose it into:
1. 3 Twitter threads (5-7 tweets each)
2. 1 LinkedIn post (professional tone)
3. 1 email newsletter section
4. 5 short-form video scripts (60 seconds)
5. 3 blog post outlines

Maintain the core message but adapt tone and format for each platform.
```

## Customization instructions
Replace `[PASTE CONTENT]` with your article, transcript, or notes. You can also specify the target platforms or the number of variations for each.

## Advanced version
Add: "For the Twitter threads, include hooks that are optimized for high engagement (use curiosity gaps and bold claims)."

## Common mistakes
- **Pasting too little content**: If the source is just a headline, the output will be generic.
- **Not specifying the 'voice'**: If you want it to sound like a specific brand, mention it.

## FAQs
**Q: Can it handle video transcripts?**
A: Yes! It works exceptionally well with YouTube or podcast transcripts to create social media clips.
