## Problem it solves
Traditional search gives you a list of links. This prompt turns your AI into an actual research assistant that synthesizes information, identifies contrasting viewpoints, and provides practical implications.

## The Prompt
```text
Research [TOPIC] and provide:

1. A comprehensive overview (200 words)
2. Key findings with citations
3. Contrasting viewpoints
4. Practical implications
5. Recommended next steps

Use recent sources (2024-2026) and cite all claims.
```

## Customization instructions
Replace `[TOPIC]` with the specific subject you want to research. You can also add "Focus on [SPECIFIC ANGLE]" to narrow down the research.

## Advanced version
Add: "Include a table comparing the top 3 solutions/products in this space, including price, target audience, and key differentiator."

## Common mistakes
- **Too broad topic**: "Research AI" is too broad. Use "Research the impact of Agentic AI on B2B SaaS in 2026."
- **Old sources**: If you don't specify the year, AI might use outdated training data.

## FAQs
**Q: Do I need a paid AI model for this?**
A: For best results with citations, use a model with real-time web access like Perplexity Pro or ChatGPT Plus.
