## Problem it solves
Many developers struggle to translate a vague app idea into a concrete system architecture. This prompt bridges that gap by forcing the AI to think as a Senior Software Architect.

## The Prompt
```text
You are an expert software architect. I want to build [DESCRIBE YOUR APP]. 

Please:
1. Propose a system architecture
2. Identify the key components
3. Suggest the tech stack
4. Outline the implementation steps

Be specific and practical. Focus on modern best practices.
```

## Customization instructions
Replace `[DESCRIBE YOUR APP]` with a detailed description of your project. For best results, mention:
- Target audience
- Key features
- Any specific technologies you MUST use

## Advanced version
Add this to the end: "Also, provide a Mermaid diagram for the data flow and identify potential scalability bottlenecks in the proposed architecture."

## Common mistakes
- **Being too vague**: "I want to build a better Facebook" is not enough.
- **Ignoring the tech stack**: If you have a preference (e.g., Next.js), specify it.

## FAQs
**Q: Does this work with GPT-4?**
A: Yes, but it performs remarkably well with Claude 3.5 Sonnet's coding capabilities.
