## Problem it solves
Non-coders using AI to generate code often miss critical security vulnerabilities. This prompt acts as a safety net, auditing your code for common risks before you deploy it.

## The Prompt
```text
I have this code for [describe what the code does, e.g., a login page]. Act as a Senior Security Engineer. Review this code for vulnerabilities, specifically looking for:

•   Injection risks (SQLi, XSS, Command Injection)
•   Broken authentication or authorization logic
•   Hardcoded secrets (API keys, passwords)
•   Overly permissive settings

List each risk found, explain why it’s a danger for a non-coder, and provide the secure, rewritten version of the code.
```

## Customization instructions
Replace `[describe what the code does]` with the context of your file. Paste your code below the prompt.

## Advanced version
Add: "Also, check if any libraries used have known vulnerabilities (CVEs) and recommend specifically 'Fixed' versions if they exist."

## Common mistakes
- **Pasting incomplete code**: If you only paste half a function, the AI can't see the full context of potential leaks.
- **Ignoring the warnings**: Many users see the risks but don't implement the secure version because it looks "more complicated."

## FAQs
**Q: Can it find all bugs?**
A: No AI is perfect. Use this as a first layer of defense, but for production apps, always seek a professional security audit.
