prompt: "You suggested I use the library '[Library Name]'. Is this a real, well-maintained library? Check if it has a high download count on [npm/PyPI] and if there are any known 'typosquatting' risks or security advisories associated with it. If it's obscure, suggest a more standard, secure alternative."

## Problem it solves
AI models sometimes suggest libraries that don't exist (hallucinations) or, worse, libraries that have been taken over by malicious actors (typosquatting). This prompt helps you verify a library's legitimacy before you `npm install`.

## The Prompt
```text
You suggested I use the library '[Library Name]'. Is this a real, well-maintained library? Check if it has a high download count on [npm/PyPI] and if there are any known 'typosquatting' risks or security advisories associated with it. If it's obscure, suggest a more standard, secure alternative.
```

## Customization instructions
Replace `[Library Name]` with the package name. Specify the registry (`npm` or `PyPI`).

## Advanced version
Add: "Also, check the license of the library. Is it MIT, Apache 2.0, or something more restrictive that could affect my project?"

## Common mistakes
- **Trusting the AI blindly**: Just because GPT-4 said it exists doesn't mean it does.
- **Ignoring the download count**: Real libraries usually have thousands or millions of weekly downloads.

## FAQs
**Q: Can AI really check NPM in real-time?**
A: With web browsing enabled (e.g., GPT-4o or Perplexity), it can check the latest registry data.
