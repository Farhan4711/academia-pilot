prompt: "I am deploying this code to [Service Name]. Please check the configuration for 'Public' access vulnerabilities. If there are any, suggest a 'Least Privilege' alternative that only gives access to the specific resources my app needs. Ensure no sensitive environment variables are exposed in the frontend."

## Problem it solves
Misconfigured cloud settings are the #1 cause of data breaches. This prompt helps you verify that your 'Public' access settings are as restrictive as possible while still allowing your app to function.

## The Prompt
```text
I am deploying this code to [Service Name]. Please check the configuration for 'Public' access vulnerabilities. If there are any, suggest a 'Least Privilege' alternative that only gives access to the specific resources my app needs. Ensure no sensitive environment variables are exposed in the frontend.
```

## Customization instructions
Replace `[Service Name]` with AWS, Azure, Vercel, etc. Paste your config (e.g., `amplify.yml` or `serverless.yml`) below.

## Advanced version
Add: "Check for compliance with the CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark and list any violations found."

## Common mistakes
- **Leaving 'All Access' on**: It's easier to debug when everyone can see it, but it's a security nightmare.
- **Hardcoding ENV variables**: Never put your database password in the config file.

## FAQs
**Q: Can this replace a devops engineer?**
A: No, but it can find the obvious mistakes that even experts sometimes overlook in a hurry.
