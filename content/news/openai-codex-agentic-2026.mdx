faq:
  - question: "How is Codex different from GitHub Copilot?"
    answer: "Copilot is autocomplete. Codex is autonomous. Copilot suggests the next line. Codex builds entire features while you're offline."
  - question: "Can I use Codex with my existing projects?"
    answer: "Yes. Connect your GitHub repo, add an `AGENTS.md` file with your project rules, and start queuing tasks."
  - question: "Does Codex work on Windows or Linux?"
    answer: "Currently macOS only. Windows and Linux versions are 'coming soon' according to OpenAI."
  - question: "What happens if the agent makes a mistake?"
    answer: "All changes go through Pull Requests. Your main branch is never touched directly. Review, approve, or reject just like any human contributor."
  - question: "Is this going to replace developers?"
    answer: "No. It shifts developers from implementation to architecture and orchestration. You become a 'conductor' managing an agent orchestra rather than playing every instrument yourself."

The developer landscape officially shifted on **February 2, 2026**, when OpenAI dropped the native **Codex App for macOS**. While we've lived through the era of "AI autocomplete," this new release marks the transition into **Agentic Development 2.0**—where we stop writing code alongside an AI and start managing a swarm of agents that code for us while we sleep.

Here is a deep dive into the features, architecture, and the "Agentic OS" workflow that is currently defining the 2026 dev cycle.

## The Core Promise: Parallel Autonomous Coding

The standout feature of the new Codex is its ability to **queue tasks in parallel**. In the "old" 2024 workflow, you'd wait for a chat response. In 2026, Codex allows you to set up different environments, connect to your GitHub repositories, and queue a massive backlog of features or bug fixes.

* **Asynchronous Execution:** You describe the goal, and Codex spawns isolated "worktrees."
* **Background Productivity:** You can step away, close your laptop, or go for a run. Codex works autonomously in the cloud.
* **Mobile Command Center:** Integrated with the ChatGPT mobile app, you receive real-time notifications on your phone. You can track agent decisions, approve terminal commands, and watch your project progress via a "Mobile Progress Bar."

## Under the Hood: The Codex One (o3-Powered) Model

The app runs on a specialized architecture called **Codex One**.

* **Reasoning Foundation:** It is built on OpenAI's **o3 reasoning model**, which means it doesn't just predict the next token—it *thinks* through the logic before writing a single line.
* **Benchmark Dominance:** Fine-tuned specifically for senior-level programming, the current **GPT-5.2-Codex** model holds the top spot on **TerminalBench**, showing a 75% accuracy rate on complex multi-file engineering tasks.

## Key Features and Workflow: From Prompt to PR

The interface is a "Command Center" for agents. It bypasses the complexity of a local terminal by using isolated cloud sandboxes.

### 1. Risk-Free Sandbox
Every task runs in a Docker-like container. Codex clones your repo, runs builds, and executes tests in a safe environment.

### 2. GitHub Integration
When a task is complete, Codex doesn't just give you code; it opens a **Pull Request (PR)**. This is crucial—if the agent makes a mistake, your main branch remains untouched until you review and merge.

### 3. AGENTS.md: The Agentic Rulebook

The platform relies on a file called `AGENTS.md` (or `.agents.md`) in your repository root. This is where you define project-specific rules:

* *"Always use pnpm instead of npm."*
* *"Run vitest before proposing a PR."*
* *"Prefer Tailwind utility classes over custom CSS."*

## The "Hybrid" Workflow: Codex + Replit/Cursor

One of the most powerful ways developers are using Codex in 2026 is as a **Specialist Debugger**.

### The Delegate Strategy
Use an IDE like **Cursor** or **Replit** for your active, creative frontend work. When you hit a complex, "brain-melting" backend bug, you delegate that specific task to Codex.

### The Sync
Since both tools sync via GitHub, Codex fixes the bug in the background, pushes the change, and you simply "pull" it back into your IDE to see the results.

## Current Limitations: The "No Internet" Sandbox

For all its power, Codex operates under a **Strict Security Sandbox**.

* **No Live Installs:** For security reasons, the cloud environment has limited/no outbound internet access during the execution phase.
* **The "Pre-flight" Requirement:** You must ensure all necessary libraries and environment variables are pre-configured in your project settings before the agent starts. It cannot "search the web" to find a new library to solve your problem mid-task.

## Verdict: Is Your Payroll Becoming "Compute"?

The bottom line is clear: We have shifted from **Human-Capital** to **Compute-Capital**. Your ability to scale as a developer in 2026 is no longer limited by how many hours you can sit at a desk, but by your **Prompt Architecture** and your ability to orchestrate an agentic swarm.
