## Why it's a Pilot's Pick
Claude 3.5 Sonnet has redefined what we expect from a coding assistant. Its 'Artifacts' feature allows for real-time visualization of react components, websites, and diagrams, making it the perfect companion for the 'Vibe Coding' methodology where speed and intuition are key.

## Best for
- Rapid prototyping of web applications
- Complex code refactoring
- Creative writing with a human-like touch
- Orchestrating multi-step agentic tasks

## How to use it in your workflow
Use Claude as your "Lead Architect" or "Senior Developer" agent. It excels at taking high-level requirements and turning them into functional code blocks. Use the Artifacts window to iterate on designs in real-time.

## Pricing
Free daily limits. $20/month for Pro which gives 5x more usage and early access to new features.
