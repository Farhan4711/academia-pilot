## Why it's a Pilot's Pick
Cursor is more than just an IDE with a chat sidebar; it understands your entire codebase. Its 'Composer' mode allows you to generate entire features across multiple files with a single prompt, making it the primary tool for 'Vibe Coding' at scale.

## Best for
- Developers who want to move 10x faster
- Managing complex, multi-file features
- Understanding large, legacy codebases
- Rapidly prototyping full-stack applications

## How to use it in your workflow
Use Cursor as your "Production Factory." Index your entire repository so the AI has context on all your utility functions and types. Use `Cmd+K` for quick inline edits and `Cmd+I` (Composer) for architectural changes.

## Pricing
Free for hobbyists. Pro plan is $20/month and provides unlimited high-speed use of advanced models like Claude 3.5 Sonnet.
